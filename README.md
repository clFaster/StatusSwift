StatusSwift is a lightweight tool that keeps your status in chat applications like Discord and Microsoft Teams set to "available." By simulating subtle mouse movements at random intervals, it prevents your status from automatically changing to "away" due to inactivity while you're reading, researching, or taking notes.

## Features

- **Automatic Status Management**: Keeps your status set to "available" in supported chat applications through unobtrusive mouse movements.
- **Smart Timing**: Uses random intervals between actions to appear more natural.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with popular chat platforms such as Discord and Microsoft Teams.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy setup and use.
- **Runtime Timer**: Tracks how long StatusSwift has been active in your current session.
- **System Tray Integration**: Easily access StatusSwift from your system tray with status information.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design that adapts to both light and dark modes.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify under the GPL-3.0 license.

## Usage

- Open StatusSwift.
- Click the "Enable StatusSwift" button to activate.
- The timer will show how long StatusSwift has been running.
- Minimize or close the window to continue running in the background.
- Access StatusSwift anytime from the system tray icon.
- When finished, click "Disable StatusSwift" or exit from the tray menu.

## How It Works

StatusSwift works by simulating small mouse movements at random intervals between 30-180 seconds. These movements are subtle (just a few pixels) and designed to be unobtrusive while you work. The application runs efficiently in the background, with minimal resource usage, making it ideal for daily use without impacting system performance.
