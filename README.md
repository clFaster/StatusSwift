- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with popular chat platforms such as Discord and Microsoft Teams.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy setup and use.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify under the GPL-3.0 license.

## Usage

- Open StatusSwift.
- Select "Enable StatusSwift".
- Minimize to hide it in the system tray.
- StatusSwift will run in the background and keep your status set to "available" on supported platforms.
